<h2>SIDESHOT</h2>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height:0.1; margin-bottom:30px;"> built with Phaser.js</p>

<p>This is the story of a kid bored in class, that decides to doodle on his notebook paper instead of taking notes.  He eventually falls asleep and finds himself in a dream of his creation!  Playing the part of his spaceship doodle that shoots eyeballs, you fight mathbooks, rulers and other school related enemies that flood the screen.</p>

<h3>Known Bugs / TODO List -</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sound doesnt activate until spaceship shoots for the first time</li>
        <li>Healthbar and Shieldbar should fill with respective colors (red, blue) for visiblity on health and sheild</li>
        <li>Sheild values/functions dont actually exist in code</li>
        <li>Code needs to be restructured before it turns into spaghetti</li>
        <li>Add more types of enemies, new wave patterns of movement, and maybe some of them should shoot</li>
        <li>Maybe add levels instead of endless mode with increasing amounts of enemies</li>
        <li>Make 'Boss' (Enemy/Enemies): Thinking it could be the teacher "waking" the student with maybe different waves of numbers, letters, equations</li>
    </ul>
